# Introduction / Business Problem
***
Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get you started:
In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.
In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?
These are just a couple of many ideas and problems that can be solved using location data in addition to other datasets. No matter what you decide to do, make sure to provide sufficient justification of why you think what you want to do or solve is important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in your project.

# Project Idea
***
FourSquare is a mobile phone service website based on user location information (LBS), and encourages mobile phone users to share their current location and other information with others. Therefore, we can know whether restaurants in a certain area are more popular through this website. Generally speaking, the popularity of restaurants in a certain area is related to the income and population density of a certain area. Therefore, I will combine the data from the Beijing Bureau of Statistics and the data provided by Foursquare to provide recommendations for restaurant location.<br>
Websites: http://nj.tjj.beijing.gov.cn/nj/main/2019-tjnj/zk/indexch.htm; https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Beijing%2C%20Beijing%20Shi&nearGeoId=72057594039744606

#Methodology
***
I used the combination of the 2019 Beijing Census information and the map to visually show the wealthier and densely populated neighborhoods, while the Foursquare data shows the current restaurants in each area

#Result
***
Comparing the map, we can see that most restaurants are located in Dongcheng District and Chaoyang District, although some of the most prosperous and densely populated neighborhoods are in Xicheng District. Therefore, population density and per capita income do not reflect the number of restaurants.

#Discussion
***
This may be related to the insufficient sample size provided by Foursquare

#Result
***
This report may be helpful to those who wish to open a restaurant in Beijing, but it should also be considered in terms of population movement, transportation convenience and rent in Beijing.
